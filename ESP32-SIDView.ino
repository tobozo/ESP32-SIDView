  ESP32-SIDView
  https://github.com/tobozo/ESP32-SIDView

  This project is an attempt to provide a visual dimension to chiptune music and
  is heavily inspired by SIDWizPlus (https://github.com/maxim-zhao/SidWizPlus).

  You'll need either a genuine SID6581 or any clone (FPGASID, TeenSID, SwinSID, etc)
  and a PCB handling the communication with the ESP32 along with the audio output.
  See the /pcb/ folder of this project for more details about the hardware.
